## Osaka

Bright, gaudy and playful: Osaka provides ample amusement with little pretension

#### Osaka is a charming, relaxed city best known for its food, fun and nightlife—with some history and culture peeking through

Osaka is only a short shinkansen ride from Tokyo, but has a very  different personality to Japan's capital city. Hop off the bullet train  into an area of exciting nightlife, delicious food and straight-talking,  friendly locals.  Along with plenty of shopping and modern attractions, Osaka also has a  historical side, the highlight of which is [Osaka Castle](https://www.japan.travel/spot/1087).  The castle is a great place to discover more about Japanese history and  to wander the beautiful grounds, especially during cherry blossom  season in April when the sakura blooms and the weather is often at its  best.        

#### How To Get There

From  Tokyo, take the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka Station. The  trip takes approximately two and a half hours. From Shin-Osaka Station,  transfer to the JR local line and ride to Osaka Station. From Kansai  International Airport (KIX), take the Nankai or JR lines to Tennoji or  Namba stations.

## Kyoto

The old imperial capital and cultural heart of Japan

#### Kyoto is the former capital city of Japan and world-famous for its refined culture, dining, and charm of rural Japan

Kyoto City attracts millions of local and international visitors  each year looking for traditional Japanese culture. Temples and shrines  such as [Kiyomizudera Temple](https://www.japan.travel/spot/2199) and Kinkakuji draw lots off attention from visitors, as do the bamboo groves of nearby [Arashiyama](https://www.japan.travel/spot/1142).  Stay in a traditional ryokan, take a dip in a rejuvenating onsen, and  enjoy the seasonal changes of cherry blossoms and brilliant autumn  foliage. Kyoto's magic is only a short bullet train ride from Tokyo.  Beyond the city lie Kyoto Prefecture's many attractive rural areas. In  the north, Amanohashidate has long been considered one of Japan's three  most scenic places. Nestled in the mountains, [Miyama](https://www.japan.travel/spot/52)  is one of the last towns with thatched-roof farmhouses, many of which  are still inhabited. Enjoy delicious local vegetables and the famous  green tea grown in [Uji](https://www.japan.travel/spot/2017).
